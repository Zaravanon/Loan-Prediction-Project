Loan Prediction - Binary Classification Problem

Problem Statement: 

Our goal is to predict the loan default prediction using given independent variables. In the dataset, the target variable is "Loan" and its a binary classification problem.

Hypothesis Generation: 

Without having the domain knowledge, we cannot do hypothesis generation, it is just a educated guess, we do before looking into the data. I have generated some hypothesis based on the knowledge I have in this domain. It is just a list of factors which have impact on our target variable.

1) If a person has a credit history value as 1, the probability for that person to get the loan is more.

2) Customer who gets more number of income has fair chance to get loan.

3) If term is low, probability of getting loan is high.

4) People who have property in urban and semiurban has maximum probability of loan approval when compared to rural.
